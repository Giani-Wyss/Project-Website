            Renato Simunović, born on 28 June 1994 in Bietigheim-Bissingen in Germany, is the son of a Croatian guest worker. His parents are both Croatian, but his father is originally from Bosnia and his mother from Herzegovina. The family moved often, which was particularly hard for Rin. Later, he failed high school due to a lack of interest. After graduating from school, Rin did nothing for three years. During this time, he started listening to trap music and freestyling. Later, he started studying media business, which he quit a short time later to concentrate on his music career.
